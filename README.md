### Common Features of Krunker.io Hacks, Aimbots, and Mods
These tools typically modify the game’s code or inject scripts (often via browser extensions like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey) to alter gameplay. Here are the most frequently mentioned features:

1. **Aimbot Features**:
   - **Auto-Aim**: Automatically locks the player’s crosshair onto the nearest enemy, visible or not, reducing the need for manual aiming. Some scripts allow adjusting the smoothing factor for more natural-looking aim (e.g., slower lock for less detection).
   - **Triggerbot**: Automatically fires when the crosshair is over an enemy, ensuring instant shots without manual input.
   - **Silent Aimbot**: Aims without visibly moving the crosshair on the player’s screen, making it harder for spectators to detect.
   - **Aim Assist/Correction**: Subtly adjusts aim to improve accuracy without fully automating it, sometimes customizable for precision.
   - **FOV (Field of View) Check**: Limits aimbot targeting to enemies within a specified field of view, customizable with a FOV box size.
   - **Aim at NPCs/AIs**: Extends aimbot functionality to non-player characters in certain modes.
   - **No Recoil**: Eliminates weapon recoil, allowing for consistent aim during sustained fire.
   - **Quickscoper**: Increases the speed of scoping in for sniper weapons, enabling faster shots.

2. **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) and Wallhacks**:
   - **Wallhack/X-Ray**: Reveals enemy positions through walls, often displaying their names, health, distance, or weapon loadouts.
   - **ESP Lines**: Draws lines from the player to enemies, indicating their exact location even when obscured.
   - **Chams/Wireframe**: Highlights enemies with colored outlines or wireframe models, making them visible through walls or in low-visibility conditions.
   - **Player Tracers**: Shows trails or markers indicating enemy movement paths.

3. **Movement and Speed Hacks**:
   - **Bunny Hop (Bhop)**: Automates or enhances bunny hopping, a technique for faster movement and dodging by chaining jumps.
   - **Speed Hack**: Increases the player’s movement speed beyond normal limits, making it easier to evade or chase enemies.
   - **Auto-Reload/No Reload**: Automatically reloads weapons or removes reload time entirely, allowing continuous firing.

4. **Other Mod Features**:
   - **No Fire Limit**: Removes restrictions on firing rate, enabling rapid shots for certain weapons.
   - **Fast Healer**: Speeds up health regeneration or healing actions.
   - **Infinite Ammo**: Provides unlimited ammunition, eliminating the need to reload or conserve bullets.
   - **Custom Crosshair**: Modifies the crosshair for better visibility or aiming precision, though this can also be a legitimate setting tweak.
   - **FPS Counter**: Displays real-time frame rate, useful for monitoring performance impacts of hacks.
   - **Mod Menu**: A graphical interface (often toggled with keys like “C” or “H”) to enable/disable features or adjust settings like aimbot smoothing or ESP visibility.

5. **Visual and Performance Mods**:
   - **High Shaders**: Enhances graphics quality for better visuals, though it may reduce FPS.
   - **Ultimate Performance**: Lowers graphical settings to boost FPS, exported as JSON settings for easy import.
   - **Hide Advertisements**: Some scripts block ads on the Krunker.io website, though this may benefit the script author more than the user.

### Technical Implementation
- **Userscripts**: Most hacks are distributed as JavaScript userscripts, installed via browser extensions like Tampermonkey (for Chrome/Opera) or Greasemonkey (for Firefox). These scripts hook into the game’s code to manipulate aim, rendering, or input handling.
- **Bypass Anti-Cheat**: Some scripts claim to evade Krunker’s anti-cheat by limiting simultaneous script usage or using VPNs to mask IP addresses, as detection can lead to game-loading issues or bans.
- **Advanced Methods**: Sophisticated aimbots may use machine learning (e.g., YOLOv4 object detection) to identify players and control mouse movement via hardware like Arduino to avoid software-based anti-cheat detection.
